# My Portfolio

## About

This is my web developer portfolio that I have made so i can show potential employers some of my skills when it comes to web development. I've included links to my email, GitHub page, and two of the assignments I have done within the Coding Bootcamp. I am very proud of how it turned and i'm looking forward to updating as the course continues to a fully responsive and impressive portfolio.
